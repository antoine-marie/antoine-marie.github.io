I'm a student at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon. Last year, I obtained a Master degree in [[http://www.ens-lyon.fr/MasterSDM/en/master-2/m2-computational-physics-and-chemistry]["Computational physics and chemistry"]]. As a requirement to get the ENS' diploma, I'm currently spending a year as a research intern, prior to my PhD which should start during the 2022-23 academic year.
I have a keen interest for theoretical chemistry and, in particular, electronic structure theory.

Currently, I'm working under the supervision of [[https://www.hughburton.com/][Hugh Burton]] at the Physical and Theorical Chemistry Laboratory in Oxford. This research internship will lasts 5 months during which we will be working on the [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01518][Energy Landscape of Electronic Structure]]. Especially, we will be interested in the MCSCF formalism.

My second internship will take place at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam within [[https://www.paolagorigiorgi.org/paola-gorigiorgi/][Paola Gori-Giorgi's group]]. During this internship I will learn the Strictly Correlated Electrons formalism of Density Functional Theory.

In addition, I'm really interested by Linux, Emacs, Org mode and more generally free and open softwares, although I'm still on the learning curve. You can find some resources that I found useful about some of these subjects on this [[file:bookmarks.org][page]] of my website.
