I'm a second year PhD student in the group of [[https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/][Pierre-François Loos]] at the Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques in Toulouse.
I have a keen interest for theoretical chemistry and, in particular, electronic structure theory.
My research focus on the development of Green's function-based methods for quantum chemistry.
In particular, I'm really interested in post-GW self energies, so-called vertex corrections.
In addition, I also quite like state-specific excited-state wavefunction methods even if I'm not working on this right now.

Before my PhD I obtained a Master degree in [[http://www.ens-lyon.fr/MasterSDM/en/master-2/m2-computational-physics-and-chemistry]["Computational physics and chemistry"]] at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.
During this period, I had the opportunity to do two internships, both in the same group as my current one, during which I worked on analytic extension of perturbation theory in the complex plane in quantum chemistry (see Ref. [[file:publications.org][1]]) and on state-specific variational coupled-cluster excited-state solutions (see Ref. [[file:publications.org][3]]).

Finally, prior to my PhD, to fulfill the requirement of the ENS' diploma, I spent one year abroad as a research intern.
During this time, I spent five months at the Physical and Theorical Chemistry Laboratory in Oxford.
There, I worked under the supervision of [[https://www.hughburton.com/][Hugh Burton]] on the multiple stationary points of the CASSCF energy landscape.
Then, I moved to Amsterdam to learn, within [[https://www.paolagorigiorgi.org/paola-gorigiorgi/][Paola Gori-Giorgi's group]], the Strictly Correlated Electrons formalism of Density Functional Theory.
We used this method to investigate a one-dimensional model of many-body localization.

In addition, I'm really interested by Linux, Emacs, Rust and more generally free and open softwares, although I'm still on the
learning curve.
I hope that, one day, I will be able to contribute to such projects.
You can find some resources that I find useful about some of these subjects on this [[file:bookmarks.org][page]] of my website.
