I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Dominika Zgid's group at the University of Warsaw.
I am a theoretical chemist with a keen interest for electronic structure theory.
In particular, I really like investigating the connection with adjacent fields such as nuclear physics, condensed matter or materials science.
Currently, I'm working on the description of magnetic compounds with strong spin-orbit coupling using a relativistic $GW$ framework.

I did my PhD in [[https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/][Pierre-François Loos']] group at the Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques in Toulouse.
My research was focusing on the development of Green's function-based methods for quantum chemistry (see, for example, Ref. [[file:publications.org][7 and 13]]).
In particular, I was very interested in post-$GW$ self-energies, so-called vertex corrections (see Ref. [[file:publications.org][14]]).
In the mean time I was also extending the [[https://lcpq.github.io/QUESTDB_website/][QUEST]] database of excitation energies to ionization potentials (see Ref. [[file:publications.org][10]]).

Before my PhD I obtained a Master degree in [[http://www.ens-lyon.fr/MasterSDM/en/master-2/m2-computational-physics-and-chemistry]["Computational physics and chemistry"]] at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.
During this period, I had the opportunity to do two internships, both in the same group as my current one, during which I worked on analytic extension of perturbation theory in the complex plane in quantum chemistry (see Ref. [[file:publications.org][1]]) and on state-specific variational coupled-cluster excited-state solutions (see Ref. [[file:publications.org][3]]).

Finally, prior to my PhD, to fulfill the requirement of the ENS' diploma, I spent one year abroad as a research intern.
During this time, I spent five months at the Physical and Theorical Chemistry Laboratory in Oxford.
There, I worked under the supervision of [[https://www.hughburton.com/][Hugh Burton]] on the multiple stationary points of the CASSCF energy landscape.
Then, I moved to Amsterdam to learn, within [[https://www.paolagorigiorgi.org/paola-gorigiorgi/][Paola Gori-Giorgi's group]], the Strictly Correlated Electrons formalism of Density Functional Theory.
We used this method to investigate a one-dimensional model of many-body localization.
