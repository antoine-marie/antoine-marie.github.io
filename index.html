Hello!
</p>

<p>
I'm a first year PhD student in the group of <a href="https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/">Pierre-François Loos</a> at the Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques in Toulouse.
I have a keen interest for theoretical chemistry and, in particular, electronic structure theory.
My research focus on the development of new correlated methods for the description of excited states in quantum chemistry.
In particular, I'm interested in the Coupled-Cluster and GW formalisms.
</p>

<p>
Before my PhD I obtained a Master degree in <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/MasterSDM/en/master-2/m2-computational-physics-and-chemistry">"Computational physics and chemistry"</a> at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.
During this period, I had the opportunity to do two internships, both in the same group as my current one, during which I worked on analytic extension of perturbation theory in the complex plane in quantum chemistry (see Ref. <a href="publications.html">1</a>) and on excited-states solutions in the variational coupled-cluster formalism (see Ref. <a href="publications.html">3</a>).
</p>

<p>
Finally, prior to my PhD, to fulfill the requirement of the ENS' diploma, I spent one year abroad as a research intern.
During this time, I spent five months at the Physical and Theorical Chemistry Laboratory in Oxford.
There, I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.hughburton.com/">Hugh Burton</a> on the multiple stationary points of the CASSCF energy landscape.
Then, I moved to Amsterdam to learn, within <a href="https://www.paolagorigiorgi.org/paola-gorigiorgi/">Paola Gori-Giorgi's group</a>, the Strictly Correlated Electrons formalism of Density Functional Theory.
We investigated the description of many-body localization by this model.
</p>

<p>
In addition, I'm really interested by Linux, Emacs and more generally free and open softwares, although I'm still on the
learning curve.
I hope that, one day, I will be able to contribute to such projects.
You can find some resources that I find useful about some of these subjects on this <a href="bookmarks.html">page</a> of my website.
