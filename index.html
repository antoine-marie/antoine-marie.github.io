Hello!
</p>

<p>
I'm a second year PhD student in the group of <a href="https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/">Pierre-François Loos</a> at the Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques in Toulouse.
I have a keen interest for theoretical chemistry and, in particular, electronic structure theory.
My research focus on the development of Green's function-based methods for quantum chemistry.
In particular, I'm really interested in post-GW self energies, so-called vertex corrections.
In addition, I also quite like state-specific excited-state wavefunction methods even if I'm not working on this right now.
</p>

<p>
Before my PhD I obtained a Master degree in <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/MasterSDM/en/master-2/m2-computational-physics-and-chemistry">"Computational physics and chemistry"</a> at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.
During this period, I had the opportunity to do two internships, both in the same group as my current one, during which I worked on analytic extension of perturbation theory in the complex plane in quantum chemistry (see Ref. <a href="publications.html">1</a>) and on state-specific variational coupled-cluster excited-state solutions (see Ref. <a href="publications.html">3</a>).
</p>

<p>
Finally, prior to my PhD, to fulfill the requirement of the ENS' diploma, I spent one year abroad as a research intern.
During this time, I spent five months at the Physical and Theorical Chemistry Laboratory in Oxford.
There, I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.hughburton.com/">Hugh Burton</a> on the multiple stationary points of the CASSCF energy landscape.
Then, I moved to Amsterdam to learn, within <a href="https://www.paolagorigiorgi.org/paola-gorigiorgi/">Paola Gori-Giorgi's group</a>, the Strictly Correlated Electrons formalism of Density Functional Theory.
We used this method to investigate a one-dimensional model of many-body localization.
</p>

<p>
In addition, I'm really interested by Linux, Emacs, Rust and more generally free and open softwares, although I'm still on the
learning curve.
I hope that, one day, I will be able to contribute to such projects.
You can find some resources that I find useful about some of these subjects on this <a href="bookmarks.html">page</a> of my website.
